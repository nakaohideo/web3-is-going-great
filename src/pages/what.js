            One of the most distinguishing features of "web3" is the sheer level
            of handwaviness surrounding it. While you can find no end of press
            releases, Twitter crypto bros, and venture capitalists extolling the
            virtues of web3, you will have a much harder time finding any
            definition that's not so full of buzzwords that it becomes
            meaningless.

            Generally speaking, web3 is an umbrella term to refer to the "future
            of the Internet", which believers say will be decentralized and
            based on the blockchain. Proponents tend to tout how data won't be
            controlled by "Big Tech", and how it will be uncensorable and
            egalitarian. There is, however, no shortage of examples in this
            timeline of how many "web3" projects are indeed centralized in
            similar ways to Big Tech, as well as instances where "uncensorable"
            or "unmodifiable" platforms have removed or modified data.

            Skeptics of web3 tend to point out that decentralization was a
            founding tenet of the Internet and is not something that is only (or
            best) achieved with the blockchain. They also tend to point out the
            enormous environmental impacts of blockchain technology
            (particularly{" "}

            blockchains, including Bitcoin and Ethereum). They also often
            mention that an awful lot of web3 projects sound quite a bit like{" "}

            , and question the lack of regulation, oversight, and taxation that
            makes fraud, tax evasion, and other criminal behavior particularly
            rampant in the space.

            Ideas described as web3 tend to incorporate some of the following:
