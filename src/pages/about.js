            This is a personal project of mine, and reflects my own opinions. If
            you are looking for an unbiased descriptor of web3 and related
            technologies, there are short ones in the{" "}

              <a>Glossary</a>

            , but that is not the goal of this site. I would recommend Wikipedia
            for that (and if the pages there are lacking, I would strongly
            encourage you to{" "}

          <h3>Who am I?</h3>
          <p>
            I'm Molly White, a software engineer by trade who is also very
            passionate about free and open knowledge and resources, and
            presenting information such that it is more accessible to all.
            You'll usually find me working on and talking about Wikipedia. I
            also care very much about equity in the tech industry and online
            spaces. You can learn more about me on{" "}

            If you are interested, I also have{" "}

          <h3>Privacy and money</h3>
          <p>
            For full disclosure, I own no cryptocurrencies or NFTs. I have no
            particular financial interest in whether web3 takes off or not,
            though I have plenty of non-financial interests; after all, I do
            have to live on this planet, and I spend enough time engaging with
            the tech industry and online to care about the futures of both.
          </p>
          <p>
            I was not paid to make this site. I don't post sponsored content on
            this website or its associated Twitter account (or anywhere else for
            that matter). A few generous people have sent money to me via
            Twitter tips; I have earmarked that money for cloud hosting costs,
            which I otherwise pay out of pocket. I don't run ads or otherwise
            make money off the website in any way.
          </p>

            The site does use Google Analytics, mostly for my own curiosity. All
            IP data is anonymized, no advertising features are enabled, and data
            retention is set to the minimum value (14 months). If you would
            rather not be tracked by Google Analytics, there are great
            extensions like{" "}

            What's the number in the corner with the flames?
          </h3>
          <p>
            That's the Grift Counter (™™™)! A running total of the amount of
            money lost so far to grifts and scams, which increments as you
            scroll through the page. It doesn't update with every single post
            that mentions a monetary loss (for example, if someone transfers
            money to a dead-end wallet by mistake)—just the money lost to
            intentional thefts and scams. If it makes more sense to you to start
            with the total amount of money lost to grifts and scams, and have it
            decrement as you scroll back in time, that's an option too! Just
            click the <i className="fas fa-gear" aria-hidden={true} />
            <span className="sr-only">settings panel icon</span> and pick "Start
            at total amount scammed and subtract as you scroll". You can also
            show and hide the counter or stop the animation of the flames from
            this panel.
