            This is a personal project of mine, and reflects my own opinions. If
            you are looking for an unbiased descriptor of web3 and related
            technologies, there are short ones in the{" "}

              <a>Glossary</a>
            </Link>
            , but that is not the goal of this site. I would recommend Wikipedia
            for that (and if the pages there are lacking, I would strongly
            encourage you to{" "}

          <h3>Who am I?</h3>
          <p>
            I'm Molly White, a software engineer by trade who is also very
            passionate about free and open knowledge and resources, and
            presenting information such that it is more accessible to all.
            You'll usually find me working on and talking about Wikipedia. I
            also care very much about equity in the tech industry and online
            spaces. You can learn more about me on{" "}

          <p>
            For full disclosure, I own no cryptocurrencies or NFTs. I was not
            paid to make this site, nor do I make any money from it. I have no
            particular financial interest in whether web3 takes off or not,
            though I have plenty of non-financial interests; after all, I do
            have to live on this planet, and I spend enough time engaging with
            the tech industry and online to care about the futures of both.
          </p>
